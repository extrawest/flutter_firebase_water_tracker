    ```

## How to test
- To run all test
```shel
$ flutter test
```
- To generate codecovarege:
    - Run test with additional flag
    ```shel
    $ flutter test --coverage
    ```
  this results into **coverage/lcov.info** file creation
    - Generate html file using previosly generated lcov file
    ```shel
    $ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
    ```
    - Use **coverage/html/index html** to view current project's codecoverage
- In order to run shader warm ups use:
```shell
$ flutter drive --profile --cache-sksl --write-sksl-on-exit sksl_shader01.json --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart --target=integration_test/app_test.dart
